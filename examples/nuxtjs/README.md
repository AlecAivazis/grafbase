## How to use

You'll need to create a [New Project](https://grafbase.com/new) using your cloned repository based on this example.

Then grab the production API Key and the Endpoint,
rename your `.env.example` to `.env` and fill both properties.

<sub>\* You must wait for the first deployment to be completed and successful</sub>

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.vue`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[Server Routes](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/features/server-routes) can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/graphql. This endpoint can be edited in `src/server/api/graphql.post.ts`.
